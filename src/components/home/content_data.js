                    Hans Albert Einstein was so good at hydraulic engineering that an award was even named after him.

                    Hans was probably extremely smart, but he didn't achieve as much as his father and grandfather did.

                    What they probably didn't inherit was Albert's unusual brain structure.

                    Some of his descendants may have his IQ, or even exceed it, but they are not Albert. Albert Einstein was unique.

                    For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that viruses may live and continue to be contagious by attaching themselves to freshwater plastics, which raises questions about the possible effects on human health.

                    It has been discovered that the diarrhoea- and stomach-unsettling virus rotavirus may persist for up to three days in lake water by adhering to the surfaces of the microscopic plastic debris beads known as microplastics.

                    Physalia physalis, or Portuguese man-of-war. A siphonophore which has absolutely no brain and thus feels and knows nothing - it is merely an eating and breeding machine. It has no locomotive organs on its own. but it drifts along ocean currents and winds, the bell acting as a sail. Its sting is like pressed with a hot iron, and can cause anaphylactic shock and death on humans.
