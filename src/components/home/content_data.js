        Yes they did.

        His, and Mileva's too.

        Hans Albert Einstein was so good at hydraulic engineering that an award was even named after him.

            Hans was probably extremely smart, but he didn't achieve as much as his father and grandfather did.

            What they probably didn't inherit was Albert's unusual brain structure.
            <br /><br />
            Some of his descendants may have his IQ, or even exceed it, but they are not Albert. Albert Einstein was unique.
